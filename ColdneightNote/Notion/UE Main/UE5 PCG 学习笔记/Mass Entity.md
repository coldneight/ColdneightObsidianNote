In Unreal Engine 5 (UE5), a mass entity typically refers to a large-scale object or structure that has a significant impact on the game world and gameplay. This could include things like mountains, skyscrapers, or even entire cities. Mass entities often require special handling and optimization techniques due to their size and complexity.

With the introduction of Nanite technology in UE5, developers have the ability to render massive amounts of detail without sacrificing performance. This allows for the creation of highly detailed mass entities that can enhance the visual fidelity and immersion of a game.

UE5 also introduces the Lumen global illumination system, which provides dynamic and realistic lighting for mass entities and the surrounding environment. This helps to create a more immersive and atmospheric game world.

Overall, UE5 empowers developers to create stunning and realistic mass entities that can greatly enhance the overall gameplay experience.
